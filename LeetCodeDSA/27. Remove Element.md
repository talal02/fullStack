## 26. Remove Element
****
### Description
- Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` **in-place**. The relative order of the elements may be changed.
- Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.
- Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` slots of `nums`.
- Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with **O(1)** extra memory.
****
##### Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## Solution (JavaScript)
```
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    var idx = 0;
    for(var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if(nums[i] != val) {
            nums[idx] = nums[i];
            idx++;
        }
    }
    return idx;
};
```
