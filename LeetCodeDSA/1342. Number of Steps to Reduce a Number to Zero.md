## 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
****
### Description
- Given an integer `num`, _return the `number of steps` to reduce it to zero_.
- In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.
****
##### Example:
```
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

## Solution (JavaScript)
```
var numberOfSteps = function(num) {
    var steps = 0;
    while(num > 0) {
        if(num % 2 == 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else {
            num -= 1;
        }
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
};
```
