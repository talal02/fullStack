## 2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences
****
### Description
- A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
- You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.
- Return _the **maximum number of words** that appear in a single sentence_.
****
##### Example:
```
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
```

## Solution (JavaScript)
```
var mostWordsFound = function(sentences) {
    var max = -99;
    sentences.forEach(sentence => {
        var words = sentence.split(' ').length;
        if (words > max) {
            max = words;
        }
    });
    return max;
};
```
