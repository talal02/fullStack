## 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations
****
### Description
- There is a programming language with only **four** operations and one variable `X`:
   - `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of variable X by `1`.
   - `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of variable X by `1`.
- Initially, value of `X` is `0`;
- Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return _the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations_.

****
##### Example:
```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

## Solution (JavaScript)
```
var finalValueAfterOperations = function(operations) {
    var x = 0;
    operations.forEach(operation => {
        if(operation[0] == 'X') {
            if(operation[1] == '+') {
                x++;
            } else {
                x--;
            }
        } else if(operation[0] == '+') {
            x++;
        } else {
            x--;
        }
    });
    return x;
};
```
