# Expressions & Operators

- Let's consider expression `5 + 20`
- `5 & 20` are **operand**
- `+` is **operator**

### Types Of Operators
##### 1. Assignment Operator
   - It assigns a value to its left operand based on value of right operand. **`( = )`**
   - e.g. **`x = 5; y = x;`**
##### 2. Arithmetic Operator
   - It takes numerical values (literal or variable) as their operands and returns single numerical value.
   - e.g. **`3 + 3; 5 - 6; 3 % 5;`**
   - **`+ is addition operator`**
   - **`- is subtraction operator`**
   - **`/ is division operator`**
   - **`% is remainder operator`**
   - **`++ is increment operator`**
   - **`-- is decrement operator`**
   - **`** is Exponentiation operator`**
##### 3. comparison Operator
   - It compares its operands and return a boolean values based on whether the comparison is true or false.
   - e.g. **`30 > 20; 15 < 25; 20 == 20`**
   - **`<, >, <=, >= , !=, !==, ==, === are comparison operators`**
##### 4. Logical Operator
   - These are used with boolean values and return a boolean value depending on logical operator used.
   - e.g. **`true && false; true || true;`**
   - **`|| is Logical OR operator`**
   - **`&& is Logical AND operator`**
   - **`! is Logical NOT operator`**
##### 5. String Operator
   - The concatenation operator `( + )`  concatenates two string together and returns another string that is union of two operand strings;
   - e.g. **`'TA:' + 'LAL' returns 'TA:LAL'`**
##### 6. Ternary Operator
