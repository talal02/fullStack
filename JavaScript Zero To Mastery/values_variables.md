# Naming Convention for Variables
 1. First character must start with '_' (underscore), '$' (dollar) or with upper or lower case letter {A-Z}{a-z}
 2. Rest characters can be any number, letter, or underscore.
 3. Variable names are case sensitive e.g. myage is not MYAGE
 4. Length of variable name can be unlimited but not a good practice to use long variable name
 5. Can't use any JavaScript reserved words as variable names e.g. var, let, const, function e.t.c
 6. Allowed e.g. _myAge, _123, myAge, MyAge, Age123 e.t.c
